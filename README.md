# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
<sub> It was a pleassure having the opportunity to work with you, Louise. I have a couple important findings to discuss with you. First, a majority of the more unsuccessful Kickstarter campaigns set very high goal(s). I see a similar traits in yours. Second, many failed kickstarter campiangs fail for many reason, some that may not be directly related to asking for too much money. Lastly, there must be another factor preventing people from pledging funds to your Kickstart campaign.</sub>
